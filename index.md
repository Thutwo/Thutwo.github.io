## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, part 1 

  With lab 3, my favorite with this is when I work on pizza.cc with my partner. We both had a good time understanding the to-do, and it was straightforward. I was curious about how these simple code lines work and made it into a program. With part 2, I was curious about how Julian days work and the day difference. It was able to count the difference of each day. 

* Lab 6

  Lab 6 was my favorite since I could work with the game blackjack and how it works. Lab 6, part 2, was my best so far. I also learned how to play blackjack, and making a game is fun. I want to create a game based on this lab. It was fun being able to create something fun. I want to use this and my knowledge from this to make my own blackjack game.  

* Lab 7

  Lab 7 is also my favorite. I was curious about how to put an image into the program, and this lab helped answer my question. This lab 7 was the first lab to which I added a picture as in code. I needed help with putting in a code and linking the image in. I enjoyed the time I spent fixing the code to see which mistakes I had made and improving my skills.
